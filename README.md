# CoS - Finnish

This is a fork of DragnaCarta's excellent [Curse of Strahd: Reloaded](https://www.strahdreloaded.com). It aims to provide all the parts which are meant to be spoken by the DM in decent Finnish. Please note that some parts might be left untranslated in this repo (I found the original repository after finishing Death House). I will update this while DMing my group, so updates should be periodical and slow. PRs welcome!

### How to use this
Step 1: Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is used to read the files.

As for how to get the files, there are two possible methods: using Git (preferred) or downloading the files as a zip packet. Git is preferred because it makes it easier to update the files and makes it possible for you to participate in the translation process.

To use the Git method: 
1) Install Git and set up a GitHub account ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account))
2) Clone this repository through Git to your local machine ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate but do not how to do something, open an issue or send me a DM on Reddit ([u/sanhosee](https://www.reddit.com/user/sanhosee)).

If you just wish to download the files, there should be a green button with text "<> Code" to the right. Push it and select download as zip, then unzip the files.
