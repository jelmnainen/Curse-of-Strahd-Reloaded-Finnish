# CoS - Finnish

This is a fork of DragnaCarta's excellent [Curse of Strahd: Reloaded](https://www.strahdreloaded.com). It aims to provide all the parts which are meant to be spoken by the DM in decent Finnish. Please note that some parts might be left untranslated in this repo (I found the original repository after finishing Death House). I will update this while DMing my group, so updates should be periodical and slow. PRs welcome!

### How to use this
I suggest
1) Installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md),
2) Installing Git and setting up a GitHub account ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)])
3) Cloning this repository through Git to your local machine ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate but do not how to do something, open an issue or send me a DM on Reddit ([u/sanhosee](https://www.reddit.com/user/sanhosee)).
